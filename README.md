# Application Record Tracker
## Personal Project Description
This personal website application project was meant to allow users to create, view, edit, and delete application records for keeping 
track of jobs and internships they've applied to such as the position, company, location, salary, and many more. 

In addition, users can upload, view, and remove files and images associated with each job and internship they've applied to such as 
screenshots of the job description and skills required, their resume file, and many more.

## Tools and Technologies
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Additional front- and back-end tools and technologies for this personal web development project include:
1) JavaScript/TypeScript.
2) React.
3) HTML and Tailwind CSS.
4) Google Firebase services such as Firebase Authentication, Cloud Storage, NoSQL Cloud Firestore, and Google Analytics.
5) Vercel cloud platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
